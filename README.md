Hi, Marvin Varron here! I am 23 years old and living in the capital city of Negros Oriental. Currently working as a Virtual Assistant at an international company. 

My hobbies are reading novels, manhua/manhwa, and Wattpad books, playing online games, and cooking. 

My goals for this year are to travel to Baguio City before the year's end and learn web development - which I am currently doing.

I want to be a web developer because aside from high earning potential and more growth opportunities, being a web developer is my dream job.
